                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to control health problems."

                    correctAnswer: 0,
                    explanation: "The epidemiological triad model describes the relationship between the agent causing disease, the host, and the environment. This framework helps identify intervention points to break the chain of disease transmission."

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "Incidence measures the number of new cases of a disease in a population during a specific time period. It helps assess the risk of contracting the disease and is crucial for understanding disease dynamics."

                    correctAnswer: 2,
                    explanation: "A cohort study follows groups of individuals who are exposed and not exposed to a particular factor to compare the incidence of outcomes over time. This design is particularly useful for studying multiple outcomes from a single exposure."

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "The attack rate is the proportion of people at risk who develop a disease during a specific time period, typically during an outbreak. It helps characterize the spread and infectiousness of a disease."

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "An endemic disease is one that is constantly present to a greater or lesser degree in a particular geographic area or population group. It maintains a relatively stable pattern of occurrence."
                },
                {
                    question: "Relative risk is calculated as:",

                        "Incidence in exposed / Incidence in unexposed",

                        "Odds of exposure in cases / Odds of exposure in controls",

                    ],
                    correctAnswer: 0,
                    explanation: "Relative risk (risk ratio) compares the probability of an outcome in an exposed group to the probability in an unexposed group. A value greater than 1 indicates increased risk, while less than 1 indicates reduced risk."
                },
                {
                    question: "In a 2x2 table for disease and exposure, the odds ratio is calculated as:",

                        "(a/b) / (c/d)",
                        "(a/c) / (b/d)",

                    ],
                    correctAnswer: 2,
                    explanation: "The odds ratio = (a*d)/(b*c) where a=exposed cases, b=exposed non-cases, c=unexposed cases, d=unexposed non-cases. This measure is commonly used in case-control studies where incidence cannot be directly calculated."
                },
                {
                    question: "Which measure indicates the proportion of disease incidence that would be eliminated if the exposure were removed?",

                        "Relative risk",
                        "Attributable risk",

                    ],
                    correctAnswer: 2,
                    explanation: "Population attributable risk (PAR) estimates the proportion of disease incidence in the total population that can be attributed to a specific exposure. It considers both the relative risk and the prevalence of exposure in the population."
                },
                {

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "Sensitivity is the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the test (true positive rate). A highly sensitive test is good at ruling out disease when the result is negative (\"SnNOut\")."
